APPLICATION FAILED TO START

Description:

Failed to configure a DataSource: 'url' attribute is not specified and no embedded datasource could be configured.

Reason: Failed to determine a suitable driver class


Action:

Consider the following:
	If you want an embedded database (H2, HSQL or Derby), please put it on the classpath.
	If you have database settings to be loaded from a particular profile you may need to activate it (no profiles are currently active).


---------
Solution:
---------
One of the dependencies used is Spring Data JPA, but no configuration has been done for that.
Since we are using PostgreSQL, we need to mention the PostgreSQL URL in application.properties file.

Configuration needed:-

spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/<NameOfYourDB>
spring.datasource.username=<YourDBUsername>
spring.datasource.password=<YourDBPassword>
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect

We set the ddl-auto to update becasue it'll automatically update the table.
